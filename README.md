# ResearchDocumentation
A collection of writing samples for different research projects completed during college.

## Wellbore Data Quality and Availability in the U.S.
This is the final report composed after completing the U.S. Department of Energy's Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship.
Both R and ArcPro were used to complete the statistical and geostatistical analyses. 

## Topological Entropy and Metric Entropy [MTH 321: Introduction to Mathematical Software]
This paper, written in [LaTeX](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/ResearchDocumentation/blob/master/Topological%20Entropy%20and%20Metric%20Entropy.tex), explains how to calculate the topological and metric entropy of a DNA sequence using MatLab.
This document contains a brief description of Metric and Topological Entropy as well as other relevant topics.
Code and histograms created from given data are also included.
The full repository can be found [here](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/TopologicalEntropy); it includes the code written, data used, and LaTeX file.

## Modeling Groundwater Movement [MTH 323: Mathematical Modeling]
This paper, written in [LaTeX](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/ResearchDocumentation/blob/master/Modeling%20Groundwater%20Movement.tex), explains a simplified model I created to explain groundwater movement. 
The groundwater was assumed to contain contaminants, complicating the model.

## Research Report Memo [WR 327: Technical Writing]
This memo describes research resources for physicists studying helium reactors.
