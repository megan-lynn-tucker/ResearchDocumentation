# ResearchDocumentation
A collection of writing samples for different research projects.

## Topological Entropy and Metric Entropy
This paper, written in [LaTeX](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/ResearchDocumentation/blob/master/Topological%20Entropy%20and%20Metric%20Entropy.tex), summarizes my final project for MTH 321: Introduction to Mathematical Software.
This document contains a brief description of Metric and Topological Entropy as well as other relevant topics.
Code and histograms created from given data are also included.
The full repository can be found [here](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/TopologicalEntropy).
It includes the code written, data used, and LaTeX file.

## Wellbore Data Quality and Availability in the U.S.
This is the final report composed after completing the U.S. Department of Energy's Mickey Leland Energy Fellowship.
Both R and ArcPro were used to complete the statistical and geostatistical analyses. 

## Modeling Groundwater Movement
This paper explains a simplified model I created to explain groundwater movement for MTH 323: Mathematical Modeling. 
The groundwater was assumed to contain contaminants, complicating the model.
This paper was composed using [LaTeX](https://github.com/megan-lynn-tucker/ResearchDocumentation/blob/master/Modeling%20Groundwater%20Movement.tex).

## Research Report Memo
For WR 327: Technical Writing, I composed a brief memo describing research resources for physicists studying helium reactors.
